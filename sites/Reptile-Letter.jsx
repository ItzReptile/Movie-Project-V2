            if you are reading this you more likely starting week 6 or
            finished.But since week 6 is the last week completed/soon to complte
            I wanted to give off my experience in the beginning of the journey.
            <br /> <br /> Week 1 and week 2 were the best weeks by far starting
            html and css were extremly enjoyable and doing this project and as
            im writing this down brings me happiness,Ive never thought of
            actually doing something that'll soon be my oneiric(dream) to be
            doing.
            <br />
            <br />
            Week 3 was the beginning of a wild ride,starting javascript from
            sctrach was a total "wtf" and I had thoughts of "I dont know if this
            is for me" and started to doubt myself,The week 4 project made me
            never wanted to code again so I took a week off to get rid of my
            negative engergy,Afterwards I looked back at my week 2 project and
            as well "testimonials" to help bring my motivation back.
            <br />
            <br />I started off week 5 very very very forceful I just imagined
            myself as the person on top of the food chain in FrontEndSimplified
            as well thought of amazing creations I could be able to construct
            and hey with the knowledge and power you've gathered who knows what
            $ could come to you! As I am writing this,Im still creating my week
            6 project and I want it to give my full potential.YES! theres still
            some things I dont know,Although I attempted to create a imageslider
            (in Home) but unfortunately couldnt this project will still satisfy
            because I gave it my all even if theres still flaws.
            <br />
            <br />

            school but currently in summer break(soon to be a senior),Im doing
