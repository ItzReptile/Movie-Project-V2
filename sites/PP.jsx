              information, we will either delete or anonymize such information,
              or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
              information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
              securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
              further processing until deletion is possible.

              the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law
              allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information
              conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
              consent. Account Information If you would at any time like to

              10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES Most web browsers and some
              mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
              Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal
              your privacy preference not to have data about your online
              browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
              uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
              signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond
              to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
              communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
              for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
              we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
              this privacy notice.
